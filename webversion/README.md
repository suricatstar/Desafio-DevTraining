To be able to run this project it is necessary to download Python, preferably its most current version, via this link here:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

And to access the Google Sheets Documentation that was used to carry out this project, you must go here:

https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts

My version of the spreadsheet and the original are below respectively:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qrCimwe2_bcGwgm2Y3EtFl8zbyAHj6y2wyn3jYUoZuE/edit#gid=0

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvWJcRLj2WAeXO3ULQ_GxGm9---3SZkjMbGcXMJtt70/edit#gid=0

To run the project, it is recommended to use a text editor of your choice, I recommend visual studio code or pycharm, after that it is interesting to install at least the Google libraries by running the following code in the terminal in the WEBVERSION folder:


## Installation

```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

Furthermore, I ask you to look at the documentation in the links above, as they are too long to explain in a readme and I am available to answer any questions.
